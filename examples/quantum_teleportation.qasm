# Quantum Teleportation Protocol
# This script demonstrates the quantum teleportation protocol
# using three qubits: Alice's qubit (q0), Bell pair (q1, q2)

# Step 1: Create Bell pair between Alice and Bob (q1, q2)
H q1
CNOT q1,q2

# Step 2: Alice prepares her qubit (q0) in some state
# For demonstration, we'll put it in |1‚ü© state
X q0

# Step 3: Alice performs Bell measurement on her qubit and her half of Bell pair
CNOT q0,q1
H q0

# Step 4: Measure Alice's qubits to get classical bits
MEASURE q0
MEASURE q1

# Note: In a real implementation, Alice would send the measurement
# results to Bob, who would then apply appropriate corrections
# to his qubit (q2) to complete the teleportation
