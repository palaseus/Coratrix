### 2. Reproducibility and Determinism

**Deterministic Execution:**
- Fixed random seeds for reproducible results
- Version control for all dependencies
- Metadata tracking for experiment reproducibility
- Hash verification for data integrity

**Security Implications:**
- Deterministic execution prevents side-channel attacks
- Reproducible results enable verification
- Metadata tracking helps detect tampering

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Quantum Circuit Validation:**
- Validate qubit indices and gate parameters
- Check for malicious circuit designs
- Sanitize OpenQASM input files
- Validate measurement operations

- Check file path security
- Sanitize user inputs
- Prevent code injection

### 4. File System Security

**Safe File Operations:**
- Use secure temporary directories
- Validate file paths and permissions
- Implement secure file deletion
- Protect against directory traversal attacks

**Output File Security:**
- Secure file naming conventions
- Proper file permissions
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Secure file transfer protocols

### 5. Network Security (if applicable)

**API Security:**
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure communication protocols

**Data Transmission:**
