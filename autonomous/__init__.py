"""
Autonomous Quantum Intelligence Layer for Coratrix 4.0
====================================================

This module implements the Autonomous Quantum Intelligence Layer that transforms
Coratrix into a self-evolving, predictive quantum operating system capable of:

- Predictive orchestration and backend allocation
- Self-evolving optimization strategies
- Quantum strategy advisory and recommendations
- Autonomous analytics and telemetry
- Experimental expansion and continuous learning

This is the autonomous intelligence system that makes Coratrix
truly alive and self-optimizing.
